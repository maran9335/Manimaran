<p>Having been abandoned by his biological parents at birth, Jobs was placed for adoption when a couple from San Francisco decided to raise him. When he was in high school, he called William Hewlett, the co-founder and president of Hewlett-Packard to boldly ask for parts for his school project. Impressed by his passion for electronics and gadgets, Hewlett gave him an internship offer for the summer. It was during his interning period that he became friends with Steve Wozniak. Later, in the year 1976, Jobs invented the first Apple computer with Wozniak while working from his garage. The foundation of Apple Computers was just the beginning of an era of path-breaking discoveries as Jobs went on to transform the technological world of mobile phones and computers.</p>

<p>Emphasising the significance of feeding one’s curiosity is the most important lesson one can learn from Steve Jobs. Here are some more key career lessons that we can take away from Steve Jobs education and his life journey: 

</p>
<h2>Focus on your Interests</h2>
<p>Being a college dropout, Steve Jobs has always emphasised on how important it is to focus more on exploring your interests and then following the crowd. Study the course that you find yourself passionate about rather choosing a popular degree and then getting diverted from your dream career. Also, you must try to gain as much as practical exposure in the field you are studying to understand what it is like in the real world.

<h2>Follow Your Passion</h2>
<p>Chasing your inner calling can actually take you to the paths that are yet unknown. Jobs always stressed on the importance of following one’s heart and to be in love with what you are doing in life. You must be passionate about the career you want to pursue because that’s how you will be able to put your heart into it and achieve success.</p>
