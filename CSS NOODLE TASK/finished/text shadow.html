    <h1>TEXT SHADOW</h1>
    <p>The small town of Tranquebar, the first trading post of the Danish colony in India established in 1620, is located about two hours away from Kumbakonam on the Coromandel Coast. The major highlights of this town are an old church and a 17th-century fort. On the beach, you can find an 18th-century Danish colonial house that once belonged to the Governor of Danish India, which is now turned into a heritage hotel. </p>
