    <p> An independent union territory on the east coast of South India, Pondicherry, is a place that no one would expect to find in India. Back in the 18th century, Pondicherry or Puducherry was a French colony that still retains a distinctly French flavor. Those who feel that they need a break from India but are low on a budget will surely enjoy the taste of French culture here and the laid-back environment. Spiritual seekers frequently visit Pondicherry due to Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Bordered by the Bay of Bengal, the Promenade and the French Quarter are the most happening parts of Pondicherry. </p>
    <P>About one hour away from Chennai, there is one of the top beaches on India’s east coast known as Mahabalipuram Beach. This beach is very popular among backpackers and surfers but it is also favorable among the tourists who just want to relax at the lavish resorts there. Famous for its stone sculptures industry, Mahabalipuram is a great place to shop for handcrafted sculptures and see artisans at work. Some other tourist attractions include Five Rathas, Shore Temple, and Arjuna’s Penance.
