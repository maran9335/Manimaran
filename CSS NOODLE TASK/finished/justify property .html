    <p>An independent union territory on the east coast of South India, Pondicherry, is a place that no one would expect to find in India. Back in the 18th century, Pondicherry or Puducherry was a French colony that still retains a distinctly French flavor. Those who feel that they need a break from India but are low on a budget will surely enjoy the taste of French culture here and the laid-back environment. Spiritual seekers frequently visit Pondicherry due to Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Bordered by the Bay of Bengal, the Promenade and the French Quarter are the most happening parts of Pondicherry.
